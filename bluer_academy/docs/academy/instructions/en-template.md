This is an academy for practical AI — where theory meets real-world creation.

We offer around 30 focused [topics](../), each lasting 2–12 hours, covering everything from Linux and Git to geospatial intelligence, robotics, and AI art. 

Some topics have a capstone project, where students apply their skills in domains like AI art, machine vision for UGVs, and geospatial AI — building systems that think, see, and act in the real world.

To attend the academy, select one of the capstone projects, or bring your own project.
